# Mapping Earthquakes #
For this module, I created a map using earthquake data from the past 7 days to map earthquakes and tectonic plates. The map has 3 modes: satellite, streets, and dark. Users can also select layers in the map to view any combination of all earthquakes, tectonic lines, and major earthquakes.
